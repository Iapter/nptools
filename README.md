# nptools

illicit automations for neopets.

## Quick start

Put

```
NP_USER='username'
NP_PASS='password'
```

in a file called .env in this directory. Then run `./daemon.sh`.

## TODO

### Technical

- Read (and write??) cookies from (and to???) an actual browser. Chrome stores
  cookies in an sqlite database so this should actually be quite doable.
