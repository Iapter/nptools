nptools: a bunch of python scripts that automate repetitive activities on the popular virtual pet site Neopets.

dependencies: python2, bash, a whole bunch of python libraries including curl and sqlite3

features: playing the slots, doing dailies (most of them), and maybe eventually one day the whole process of restocking -- all from command line.

Plus, it's open source, unlike those Visual Basic GUI interfaces that track the item's NP while doing a clandestine installation of Smiley Central on the cheater's computer.

Also hi TNT of Nickelodeon of MTV of Viacom!
