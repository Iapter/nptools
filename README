nptools: a bunch of python scripts that automate repetitive activities on the popular virtual pet site Neopets.

dependencies: python2, bash, a whole bunch of python libraries including curl and sqlite3

features: playing the slots, doing the dailies (most of them), and maybe eventually one day the whole process of 
restocking -- all from command line.

Also hi TNT, part of Nickelodeon, part of MTV Networks, part of Viacom!
