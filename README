--- Intro ---
nptools is a bunch of python and bash scripts that automate repetitive activities on the popular virtual pet site Neopets.

--- Dependencies ---
python2, bash, a whole bunch of python libraries including curl and sqlite3

--- Features ---
features: playing the slots, doing dailies (most of them), and maybe eventually one day the whole process of restocking -- all from command line.

Plus, it's open source, unlike those Visual Basic GUI interfaces that track the item's NP while doing a clandestine installation of Smiley Central on the cheater's computer.

--- Contents ---
login.sh        - Logs in using 1st argument as username and 2nd argument as password
                - Stores cookies in kirls

neo.py          - Basic setting-up of curl
                - Provides some useful functions for use in other scripts

itemdb.py       - Functions to access the item database, which it stores in itemdb
                - as an sqlite3 database.
                - Can be populated with wiz.py or scrum.py
                - Might be able to be used to create an autorestocker one day

bagateller.py   - Plays the game once, printing the result
coconutter.py   -
slotplayer.py   - (Pirate slots; Brucey slots suck.)

d_*.py          - Does a certain daily.

dailies.sh      - Does most of the d_*.py scripts
                - If a d_*.py script isn't in it, then it's probably not complete

hidenseek.py    - Loops the game until it can't anymore (pet boredom, etc.)
cheeseroller.py -
dicearooer.py   -

wiz.py          - Searches the shop wizard for the first cmdline argument repeatedly
                - Usable in faerie quests, since it bypasses the form

scrum.py        - Goes through your SDB, listing the value of the items
                - as determined by itemdb.py. If the item is not in itemdb,
                - uses itemdb to add it.

dump.html       - Contains the HTML from the last page requested neo.py
