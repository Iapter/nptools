Neopets Daemon is a little app that automatically plays Neopets for you.

Feed it your username and password, and it will automatically do your dailies.
Eventually, it might even do more. Like buy stocks and play games.

It keeps track of each account in an sqlite3 database, so even if you kill it and start it again, it won't do dailies until the time is right.
